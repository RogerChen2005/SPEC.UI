        "Color_System": "The color system is defined by a sophisticated dark theme, promoting focus and clarity. The primary background color is a deep charcoal gray (#2C2C2C), while container surfaces like sidebars and cards use a slightly lighter gray (#3A3A3A) to create subtle depth. Text and icons predominantly use high-contrast white (#FFFFFF) for readability. A vibrant, acidic lime green (#ADDE75) serves as the single, powerful accent color, reserved for primary call-to-action buttons like 'Generate' and for indicating active states in tabs. This creates a clear visual hierarchy, guiding the user's attention to key interactive elements. There are also muted grays (#8C8C8C) for secondary information and icons. The content previews within the cards introduce their own palettes, but these are contained and do not interfere with the application's core color system.",
        "Layout_Structure": "The application employs a three-column fixed-sidebar layout, common in professional-grade creation tools. A fixed-width left navigation rail occupies approximately 20% of the viewport, the central main workspace takes up a fluid ~55%, and a fixed-width right properties panel fills the remaining ~25%. The entire interface is built on a dark theme, which reduces eye strain and focuses attention on the central content previews. Content is organized into distinct cards with clear headings and visual separation, creating a modular and scannable interface. The vertical rhythm within panels is consistent, with section titles, content blocks, and actions stacked logically. A base spacing unit of 8px appears to be used for padding (e.g., 16px, 24px) and margins between components, ensuring visual consistency and balance across the different functional areas. The structure is optimized for a desktop experience, prioritizing information density and efficient workflows.",
        "Shape_Language": "The shape language is predominantly rectilinear and sharp, conveying a sense of precision and professionalism suitable for a technical tool. Containers such as cards and sidebars feature sharp, 90-degree corners or a very minimal corner radius (approximately 2-4px), reinforcing the structured, grid-based layout. Buttons have a subtle corner radius (~4px), softening them just enough to be identifiable as interactive elements. Icons are line-based and adhere to a clean, modern style with sharp angles. Active states, particularly for tabs, are indicated by a thick, solid underline rather than a change in the container's shape. This flat design approach avoids heavy shadows, gradients, and excessive ornamentation, resulting in a clean, functional, and uncluttered user interface that prioritizes content over chrome.",
        "Usage_Scenario": "This UI is a specialized design and development tool for generating UI specifications or front-end code. The user is likely a designer or developer managing a project. The workflow involves navigating project assets in the left sidebar, selecting input templates or viewing generated outputs in the central workspace, and fine-tuning parameters or viewing metadata in the right-hand properties panel. Key interactions include selecting templates via radio buttons, triggering a core 'Generate' action, and inspecting detailed properties in an organized, tabbed interface. The application is designed for a productive, task-oriented session rather than casual browsing. It supports a process of iterative creation: select inputs, generate, review output, and inspect details, facilitating a rapid and efficient development cycle for UI components."

A signature accent pink (#FB7299) is used sparingly for the most important call-to-action, such as the 'Upload' button, drawing immediate user attention. A secondary accent blue (#00A1D6) is consistently applied for interactive elements like links, tabs, and secondary buttons, serving as a clear signifier for navigation. Neutral grays (#999999, #CCCCCC) are utilized for metadata, borders, and disabled states, creating a subtle visual hierarchy without adding clutter. This strategic color system effectively guides the user's eye and distinguishes between different types of interactive elements.",
        "Layout_Structure": "The page employs a fluid-width, centered layout with a maximum content width, creating stable margins on larger viewports. Its core structure is an asymmetrical two-column grid, with the main content area occupying approximately 70% of the width on the left, and a supplementary sidebar taking the remaining 30% on the right. A persistent, full-width header is fixed at the top for global navigation and search. The vertical rhythm is established by stacking functional blocks, such as the title, player, and action bar, with consistent vertical spacing of around 16-24px. The layout prioritizes the video player as the primary focal point. Spacing within components and between elements appears to follow an 8px base unit system, ensuring visual consistency and rhythm across the interface. The design is clearly structured to separate primary content consumption from secondary discovery and social interactions.",
        "Shape_Language": "The shape language is predominantly rectilinear, characterized by sharp-cornered rectangles for major containers like the video player and content cards. This creates a structured and organized feel. This angularity is softened by the selective use of rounded corners on interactive elements. For instance, buttons and input fields feature a subtle corner radius (approximately 4-6px), making them appear more approachable and clickable. Avatars are consistently circular, providing a clear visual distinction for user profiles. Icons are rendered in a simple, outlined style with clean lines, ensuring they are easily recognizable without being distracting. Overall, the design achieves a balance between formal structure and user-friendly softness, guiding interaction through shape differentiation.",
        "Usage_Scenario": "This interface is a video-watching page, designed primarily for content consumption. The user's main goal is to watch the video, which is given the most prominent placement on the screen. Secondary user tasks include social interaction (liking, sharing), information gathering (reading the description and metadata), and content discovery. The right sidebar facilitates this discovery by presenting a playlist or series episodes, as well as algorithmically recommended videos, encouraging longer user sessions. The persistent header allows users to search for new content or navigate to other parts of the site at any time. The overall experience is optimized for passive viewing combined with low-effort clicks to explore related content or express engagement."
